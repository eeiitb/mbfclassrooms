The lecture was held in hybrid mode with some students joining the lecture via video call on MS Teams. Prof. Gadre has a tradition of giving each student a pen and a notebook in the first lecture of his courses. As this was the first lecture with in-person attendance, he had brought the stationery to the lecture. All guests present helped with preparing the stationery for distribution.
