# Booking the Collaborative Classroom

## EE Faculty
Please use the [Meeting Room Booking System](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/mrbs) to book the CC. After booking a slot, if you decide to not use the CC in that slot, please remember to delete your booking. This will enable others to use that slot.

## Student Clubs
Please email [Prof. Saravanan Vijayakumaran](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva) with the event details. There are **no charges to use the CC**. 

However, we have the following requirements:

- No food or beverages are allowed inside the CC
- Use the facility responsibly (no littering, no loud music).
- If you change the layout, return the tables to the original layout.
- Share some pictures of the event with us.
- Allow us to collect feedback from the event attendees.

## Non-EE Faculty
**One-time usage**: To use the CC for one-off events (like CEP courses, seminars), please contact [Saravanan Vijayakumaran](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva) with the event details.

**Course usage**: While we welcome CC usage by non-EE faculty for conducting active learning sessions in their courses, we would like to give preference to EE faculty in a time-table slot. If a slot is not occupied by EE faculty, we can accommodate faculty from other departments. Please contact [Saravanan Vijayakumaran](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva) with your course details.
