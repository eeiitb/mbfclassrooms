# Notes from Talk on Collaborative Learning Spaces

## Context
The Collaborative Classroom is an instance of a Collaborative Learning Space (CLS). It is meant to facilitate active and collaborative learning.

The [Parimal and Pramod Chaudhari Centre for Learning and Teaching (PPCCLT)](http://www.ppcclt.iitb.ac.in/) at IIT Bombay has a state-of-the-art [collaborative learning research laboratory](http://www.ppcclt.iitb.ac.in/collaborative-learning-space/) (CLRL). It was completed in 2020.

To understand the challenges and opportunities in using the CC effectively, we invited **Dr. Mrinal Patwardhan, Academic Program Coordinator, PPCCLT**, to give a seminar about collaborative learning spaces. The seminar was held on Zoom on October 13th, 2021.


## Notes from Talk
Here are some salient points from her talk.

* **Collaborative Learning Spaces**: Formal spaces intentionally designed to promote *active learning*.
* **Studio Approach to Instructional Spaces**: The classroom is designed for discussions between small groups.

* **What type of learning process is the CLS trying to foster? Why?**
    * Students form small groups and work collaboratively in small teams.
    * The approach results in deeper learning and an enhanced learning experience.
    * Students use a variety of resources as they learn from peers and instructors.
* **Does it work?**
    * Numerous studies, with many focusing on STEM students, have demonstrated significant positive student outcomes.
        * Meaningful student interactions
        * Decreased failure rates
        * Increased student satisfaction
    * See review paper on the efficacy of CLSs covering 37 studies for more information.
        * [R. Talbert and A. Mor-Avi, A space for learning: An analysis of research on active learning spaces, Heliyon, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019366265)
* **Findings in CLS Research**
    * *Improved Learning Outcomes*
        * All studies reported either **improved learning outcomes** for students in CLSs or no significant difference in learning outcomes compared to traditional classrooms
        * Improvement in learning outcomes were **most pronounced among low-achieving and minority students.**
    * *Improved Student Engagement*
        * Preference for learning in CLSs
        * **Increased motivation** to attend class
        * Increased **willingness to participate** actively in class
        * Increased **interaction and deepened relationships** with their peers and instructor
        * Fostered a sense of community and belonging
    * *Instructors' practices and beliefs*
        * Instructors tend to change their instructional practices and their perceptions of their roles as instructors
        * Instructors used active learning techniques more frequently
* **The room itself is not enough**
    * The collaborative learning space does not magically result in better learning. The pedagogy in CLSs has to be deliberately designed for active learning.
    * [Kelsey J. Metzger, David Langley, The Room Itself is Not Enough: Student Engagement in Active Learning Classrooms, *College Teaching*, 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87567555.2020.1768357)
    * The value of CLSs lies in the enactment of student-centred pedagogies.
    * The architecture and affordances in such spaces provide the required nudging towards it.
    * One **must use active learning strategies**
### **What is Active Learning?**
* Active learning involves instructional strategies wherein
    * Students go beyond listening, copying of notes, execution of prescribed procedures
    * Instructor designs activities that **require a majority of students** to talk, write, reflect, and express their thinking.
    * It requires students to engage cognitively and meaningfully with the course content.
* *Example*: Suppose a student is listening to a lecture. The following list describes student actions in **increasing order of cognitive engagement**.
    * Listening without doing anything else
    * Taking verbatim notes, copying solution steps, repeating or rehearsing
    * Reflecting out loud, drawing concept maps, asking questions
    * Defending and arguing a position in pairs or small group
* The above example is an instance of the **ICAP Framework** which stands for Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive (in reverse order in the example).
*  [Michelene T. H. Chi & Ruth Wylie (2014), The ICAP Framework: Linking Cognitive Engagement to Active Learning Outcomes, Educational Psychologist, 49:4, 219-243](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00461520.2014.965823)
### **Active Learning Strategies**

*  Peer Instruction 
        *Eric Mazur, Harvard University, early 1980s*
* Think-Pair-Share
        *Frank Lyman, University of Maryland, early 1980s*
* Many others
    * Team-Pair-Solo
    * Problem-based learning
    * Just-in-Time Teaching
    * Role-play
    * Jigsaw
    * Case-based learning
    * Peer-review
    * Flipped classroom
    * Pair programming
#### **Peer Instruction Strategy**

*  Instructor asks a **multiple choice conceptual question**
*  Students answer individually
* Instructor allows students to discuss among themselves
* Students answer again
* Misconceptions are usually clarified
* The questions can be chosen to
    * test conceptual understanding
    * apply ideas in real world context
    * predict results of lecture demo, experiment, simulation, or algorithm (describe an experiment, ask students to predict the result, then show the demo or video).



#### **Think-Pair-Share Strategy**

#### **Jigsaw: Cooperative Learning Strategy**
![](../images/cls-talk-screenshots/No3pMvk.png)

 * Suppose a topic has four subtopics
 * Students are divided in to four groups to learn about each subtopic. They form the expert groups for a particular subtopic.
 * Form learning groups containing one student from each learning group.
 * Each expert teaches his/her subtopic to his learning group.
 * Instructor summarizes the topics at the end.


### Common Features of Effective CLS Activities
The following points describe strategies which have been seen to be effective in CLSs.

* Most of the **information transmission** in the form of a lecture by the instructor is significantly reduced or **moved out of the classroom**
* Most activities are supported by **graded** pre-class reading, homework, and quizzes or post-class homework
* Students often work in **small teams** on activities designed to provide them with a deeper understanding of the topic
* Classroom activities are typically followed by some form of **whole-class synthesis facilitated by the instructor**
    * Whatever learning has been taking place at the individual level is summarized by the instructor
    * This may take the form of a discussion, a short assessment, or a mini-lecture.
* [A Guide to Teaching in the Active Learning Classroom: History, Research, and Practice, 2016, Paul Baepler, J. D. Walker, D. Christopher Brooks, Kem Saichaie, Christina I. Petersen](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0XZvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)

### Some pointers for using a CLS
* It is better to **start with a few classes in a CLS** rather than an entire course in the CLS.
* Consider modifying just **a single lesson/topic/unit as a pilot** before thinking of running/redesigning an entire course in the CLS.
* Pick some topics/modules that have the potential for planning active learning activities
    * Topics which students generally find difficult to grasp are good candidates
* May use micro-lectures -- shorter lectures interspersed between periods of student activity
* Use of the **Backward Design Approach** may help in planning the use of the CLS.

#### What is the Backward Design Approach?

* Backward Design Approach for using a CLS
    * What should students take away/develop by using the CLS for a topic/module/course?
    * How will I assess that students have developed the required knowledge/skill/competency?
    * What learning activities do I need to plan for students to develop the required knowledge/skill/competency?
* See [Planning for using a CLS](#Planning-for-using-a-CLS) for possible answers to above questions

### Pointers for identifying topics suitable for a CLS
Topics involving the following are usually suitable
* Deep conceptual understanding
* Open-ended problem solving
* Design-based problem solving
* Real-world problem solving
* Software-based laboratory
* Mathematical modeling
* Short hands-on experimentation

- Start small if you are new to using a CLS
    - A few modules/topics instead of whole course in CLS
- Identify topics which are typically hard to grasp for students
- Identify active learning techniques which can be used
- Design the exercise which will happen in the CLS
