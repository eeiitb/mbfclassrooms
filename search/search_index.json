It is meant to facilitate active and collaborative learning. The Parimal and Pramod Chaudhari Centre for Learning and Teaching (PPCCLT) at IIT Bombay has a state-of-the-art collaborative learning research laboratory (CLRL). It was completed in 2020. To understand the challenges and opportunities in using the CC effectively, we invited Dr. Mrinal Patwardhan, Academic Program Coordinator, PPCCLT , to give a seminar about collaborative learning spaces. The seminar was held on Zoom on October 13th, 2021. Notes from Talk Here are some salient points from her talk. Collaborative Learning Spaces : Formal spaces intentionally designed to promote active learning . Studio Approach to Instructional Spaces : The classroom is designed for discussions between small groups. What type of learning process is the CLS trying to foster? Why? Students form small groups and work collaboratively in small teams. The approach results in deeper learning and an enhanced learning experience. Students use a variety of resources as they learn from peers and instructors. Does it work? Numerous studies, with many focusing on STEM students, have demonstrated significant positive student outcomes. Meaningful student interactions Decreased failure rates Increased student satisfaction See review paper on the efficacy of CLSs covering 37 studies for more information. R. Talbert and A. Mor-Avi, A space for learning: An analysis of research on active learning spaces, Heliyon, 2019 Findings in CLS Research Improved Learning Outcomes All studies reported either improved learning outcomes for students in CLSs or no significant difference in learning outcomes compared to traditional classrooms Improvement in learning outcomes were most pronounced among low-achieving and minority students. Improved Student Engagement Preference for learning in CLSs Increased motivation to attend class Increased willingness to participate actively in class Increased interaction and deepened relationships with their peers and instructor Fostered a sense of community and belonging Instructors' practices and beliefs Instructors tend to change their instructional practices and their perceptions of their roles as instructors Instructors used active learning techniques more frequently The room itself is not enough The collaborative learning space does not magically result in better learning. The pedagogy in CLSs has to be deliberately designed for active learning. Kelsey J. Metzger, David Langley, The Room Itself is Not Enough: Student Engagement in Active Learning Classrooms, College Teaching , 2020 The value of CLSs lies in the enactment of student-centred pedagogies. The architecture and affordances in such spaces provide the required nudging towards it. One must use active learning strategies What is Active Learning? Active learning involves instructional strategies wherein Students go beyond listening, copying of notes, execution of prescribed procedures Instructor designs activities that require a majority of students to talk, write, reflect, and express their thinking. It requires students to engage cognitively and meaningfully with the course content. Example : Suppose a student is listening to a lecture. The following list describes student actions in increasing order of cognitive engagement . * Listening without doing anything else * Taking verbatim notes, copying solution steps, repeating or rehearsing * Reflecting out loud, drawing concept maps, asking questions * Defending and arguing a position in pairs or small group The above example is an instance of the ICAP Framework which stands for Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive (in reverse order in the example). Michelene T. H. Chi & Ruth Wylie (2014), The ICAP Framework: Linking Cognitive Engagement to Active Learning Outcomes, Educational Psychologist, 49:4, 219-243 Active Learning Strategies Peer Instruction Eric Mazur, Harvard University, early 1980s Think-Pair-Share Frank Lyman, University of Maryland, early 1980s Many others * Team-Pair-Solo * Problem-based learning * Just-in-Time Teaching * Role-play * Jigsaw * Case-based learning * Peer-review * Flipped classroom * Pair programming Peer Instruction Strategy Instructor asks a multiple choice conceptual question Students answer individually Instructor allows students to discuss among themselves Students answer again Misconceptions are usually clarified The questions can be chosen to test conceptual understanding apply ideas in real world context predict results of lecture demo, experiment, simulation, or algorithm (describe an experiment, ask students to predict the result, then show the demo or video). Think-Pair-Share Strategy Jigsaw: Cooperative Learning Strategy Suppose a topic has four subtopics Students are divided in to four groups to learn about each subtopic. They form the expert groups for a particular subtopic. Form learning groups containing one student from each learning group. Each expert teaches his/her subtopic to his learning group. Instructor summarizes the topics at the end. Common Features of Effective CLS Activities The following points describe strategies which have been seen to be effective in CLSs. * Most of the information transmission in the form of a lecture by the instructor is significantly reduced or moved out of the classroom * Most activities are supported by graded pre-class reading, homework, and quizzes or post-class homework * Students often work in small teams on activities designed to provide them with a deeper understanding of the topic * Classroom activities are typically followed by some form of whole-class synthesis facilitated by the instructor * Whatever learning has been taking place at the individual level is summarized by the instructor * This may take the form of a discussion, a short assessment, or a mini-lecture. * A Guide to Teaching in the Active Learning Classroom: History, Research, and Practice, 2016, Paul Baepler, J. D. Walker, D. Christopher Brooks, Kem Saichaie, Christina I. Petersen Some pointers for using a CLS It is better to start with a few classes in a CLS rather than an entire course in the CLS. Consider modifying just a single lesson/topic/unit as a pilot before thinking of running/redesigning an entire course in the CLS. Pick some topics/modules that have the potential for planning active learning activities Topics which students generally find difficult to grasp are good candidates May use micro-lectures -- shorter lectures interspersed between periods of student activity Use of the Backward Design Approach may help in planning the use of the CLS. What is the Backward Design Approach? Backward Design Approach for using a CLS What should students take away/develop by using the CLS for a topic/module/course? How will I assess that students have developed the required knowledge/skill/competency? What learning activities do I need to plan for students to develop the required knowledge/skill/competency? See Planning for using a CLS for possible answers to above questions Pointers for identifying topics suitable for a CLS Topics involving the following are usually suitable * Deep conceptual understanding * Open-ended problem solving * Design-based problem solving * Real-world problem solving * Software-based laboratory * Mathematical modeling * Short hands-on experimentation Example 1: Mathematical Modeling Example 2: Jigsaw in EN207: Data Analysis and Interpretation Planning for using a CLS Main Takeaways Active learning techniques are necessary to realize the benefits of using a CLS i.e. \" the room itself is not enough \" Start small if you are new to using a CLS A few modules/topics instead of whole course in CLS Identify topics which are typically hard to grasp for students Identify active learning techniques which can be used Design the exercise which will happen in the CLS About Dr. Mrinal Patwardhan Dr. Patwardhan holds a post-graduate degree in Electronics Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai and a PhD in Educational Technology from IIT Bombay.

It uses a series of triangles to represent the surfaces of a solid model. All modern CAD (Computer Aided Design) software allow you to export their native \ufb01le format into STL. The 3D model is then converted into machine language (G-code) through a process called \u201cslicing\u201d and is ready to print. [? ] Few popular examples of 3D designing softwares are: \\1.

Sketches are the underlying geometry that support the creation of 3D solid, surface, and T-Spline bodies in your design. Ex: Lines, Shapes, Splines, Mirrors and Patterns \u2022 The Solid tab contains traditional solid modeling tools within the Design workspace in Fusion 360, and supports both parametric and solid modeling modes. 3 \u2022 The following commands in the Design workspace, in the Solid > Create panel, let you create a solid body from a closed sketch pro\ufb01le, open sketch curve, or planar face in Fusion 360. \u2013 Extrude \u2013 Revolve \u2013 Sweep \u2013 Loft \u2013 Shell \u2013 Fillet \u2013 Champer \u2013 Sweep After designing, export the STL \ufb01le and import it into the slicer software for 3D printing. There are many websites where we get STL \ufb01les of popular designs, for ex:Makerbot Thingverse:- https://www.thingiverse.com/ 4 2 Fracktory Slicer Software A slicer is computer software used in the majority of 3D printing processes for the conversion of a 3D object model to speci\ufb01c instructions for the printer. In particular, the conversion from a model in STL format to printer commands in g-code format in fused \ufb01lament fabrication and other similar processes. [? ] The slicer \ufb01rst divides the object as a stack of \ufb02at layers, followed by describ- ing these layers as linear movements of the 3D printer extruder, \ufb01xation laser or equivalent. All these movements, together with some speci\ufb01c printer commands like the ones to control the extruder temperature or bed temperature, are \ufb01nally written in the g-code \ufb01le, that can afterwards be transferred to the printer. \\1. Fracktory is a 3D slicer application developed by FRACKTAL WORKS supported by the 3D printer. \\2. Fracktory software imports the 3D design in .stl/.obj \ufb01le format (prefer- ably .stl as it can be edited). Note that the Fracktory software is used to print the model not for making the model. \\3. The model is viewed in 3D with bottom plane is build-plate of the printer. \\4. In 3D printing parameters settings, both recommended and customised options are available. In recommended settings, the parameters are set automatically based on the design imported and on the other hand, we can set each parameter manually based on the understanding and experience in the 3D printing. \\5. Various printing parameters like In\ufb01ll, Building Support etc. can be set to preferred values and more information about each one of them can be obtained by hovering over \u2018i\u2019 symbol at each setting type. For more information, refer to 10 Most Important 3D Printer Slicer Settings:- https://all3dp.com/2/3d-slicer-settings-3d-printer/ \\6. After \ufb01nalising all the print parameters, click on \u2018Prepare\u2019 option at the bottom-right corner. The estimated time to print the model is shown and the parameters can be optimised according to the necessity. 5 3 The Julia Advanced 3D Printer An Introduction to Julia Advanced is given in the link: Introduction Video:- https://youtube/FDG05gGNbcc .

Select the 3D Printer Figure 1: Select the printer. \\2. Select the material used for printing. Figure 2: Select the material. 7 \\3. Check whether the selected nozzle size is same as of the printer. Figure 3: Select the nozzle size \\4. Import the .stl \ufb01le into the Fracktory software. Figure 4: Opening the .stl \ufb01le 8 \\5. Set the 3D printing parameters according to the requirement. Beginners are encouraged to use recommended settings. Tick the Build plate adhe- sion option in the right pane. Figure 5: Select the setting(Recommended). \\6. If one wants to do customize settings then they are encouraged to change the wall thickness according to requirement and can choose the in\ufb01ll pat- tern. Figure 6: Selecting the setting(Custom). 9 Figure 7: Wall thickness option. \\7. The built-plate adhesion type among brim,raft,skirt can be chosen based on model otherwise it is mentioned in recommended settings. Figure 8: Option for In\ufb01ll. 10 Figure 9: Build plate adhesion type and it\u2019s width. \\8. After setting the print parameters, prepare .gcode \ufb01le. Figure 10: Prepare the model. 11 \\9. Export the generated .gcode \ufb01le to a USB memory device. Figure 11: Saving the model in USB memory device 12 \\10. Mount the USB memory device to the 3D printer (Julia Advanced) and select the model to be printed. Figure 12: Select the model to be printed on the USB device. \\11. Choose the storage(in this case removable disk) where the g-code \ufb01le is stored. Figure 13: Select the USB option. 13 \\12. Select the model. Figure 14: Review the model. \\13. Print. Figure 15: Printing starts. 14 \\14. Before printing the model the temperature of nozzle and build-plate rises to a required level. Figure 16: Temperature of the nozzle(left) and build-plate(right). \\15. After giving the print command the printer does the 9-point calibration by moving the nozzle at di\ufb00erent positions on the built plate. Figure 17: 9-point calibration of printer. 15 \\16. Take the model out of the printer only after the minimum temperature of built plate and nozzle is achieved. Figure 18: Model just after removing from printer. \\17. Remove the brim of the model with the cutter. Figure 19: Printed model after cutting the brim. 16 5 Calibration Calibration is one of the important step in the process of 3D printing. If the printer is correctly calibrated then one can generate the expected output min- imising errors. Calibration involves built-plate leveling and nozzle cleaning. The following steps should be followed for calibration:- \\1. On the printer menu go on calibration option. Figure 20: Select the calibrate option. 17 \\2. Select the wizard menu. Figure 21: Select the wizard option. \\3. Select \u2018Quick Calibration\u2019 and the built-plate will rise and nozzle will move through 3 points left, right and back. Figure 22: Select the quick calibration. 18 \\4. As the nozzle moves at the \ufb01rst point, tighten or loosen screw at the bottom of built-plate exactly below the position of the nozzle until the Red LED light at bottom of built-plate stops blinking and glows constantly.It may happen that Red LED may not be glowing so try to adjust the screw in both direction so that it starts blinking and then glows solidly. Figure 23: Calibration begun. Figure 24: Adjust screw up and down red led goes from blinking to solid red. 19 \\5. Then click on \u2018Next\u2019 on the screen and repeat Step 4 for the next point. Repeat the same until all the three points are \ufb01nished and then click on \u2018Done\u2019 on the screen. \\6. For nozzle cleaning, take a few drops of acetone on a cotton ball and remove the \ufb01lament at nozzle mouth. Warning: The Nozzle temper- ature should be low while doing this, which can also be seen at the screen. \\7. For removing extra \ufb01lament from nozzle mouth, go to Control Menu \u2192 Load Filament option and remove \ufb01lament until it comes out smoothly for better printing. \\8. Calibration should be done once in a week and make sure that the temperature of both nozzle and build-plate are low \\9. 3D printer should be switched o\ufb00 once the model is removed after complete printing. 6 Precautions for operating the Julia Advance 3D printer \\1. Check whether the material (e.g PLA) used in the the printer is same as speci\ufb01ed in the Fracktory software. \\2. The calibration of the nozzle and the built plate is important otherwise printer will not design the shape correctly. \\3. The nozzle and built plate must be clean, dust particles may deteriorate the model. \\4. The nozzle and built plate are to be preheated to certain temperature to make the material \ufb02ow smooth. \\5. Initially, run the nozzle for some time to remove some of the material ensuring smooth \ufb02ow for the design. \\6. Before printing, ensure if the model to be printed and the model in the display of the printer monitor are same. Sometimes, it may take hours to print the model. \\7. The time for printing and overall time is mentioned on the printer display when model is in process of printing , model should be removed only after the overall time is passed. 20","title":"Julia Single Nozzle 3D Printer User Manual(25 05 2022)"},{"location":"ell/equipment/","text":"Equipment","title":"Equipment"},{"location":"ell/equipment/#equipment","text":"","title":"Equipment"}]}
